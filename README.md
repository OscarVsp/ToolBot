# ToolKitsBot

This is a small discord bot written in python using the [disnake library](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake), implenting various tools features for my servers.

I don't plan to make a well documented repo here, but feel free check the code if you want.

# docker

`docker push oscarvsp/toolkitsbot:amd-latest`
